# HTML Tutoring project

### 🔥 Motivation 🔥
As a tutor I need to adjust teaching methods to each student. This month, however, I was asked for an extreme course, not found anywhere on the internet, completly subordinated to my student's needs. It was to be made fun and compact. That's why I resigned from any standard academic approach. Here is my take on the issue.

### 🧱 Structure 🧱

The first project (chapters 1-2) is a case study of a colorful pattern.
The image we try to reproduce can be found [here](https://www.redbubble.com/es/i/poster/Dise%C3%B1o-de-la-lista-de-verificaci%C3%B3n-diaria-de-docenas-c%C3%B3mo-no-morir-de-PlantVictorious/42599988.LVTDI). Together with my student, we opted for the less-theory-more-practice classes. Thus, however unordered the structure might look like, it focuses on general picture, presenting examples and counter-examples of coding practices.
1. **Chaprter 0** - files prepared by me for my student.
2. **Chaprter 1** - construction of the main HTML file and its refactoring according to some of the best coding practices. Finishes with a presentable project.
3. **Chaprter 2** - thinking outside the box; how to do it differently? *Grid*, *flex* and *table* layouts overview.
